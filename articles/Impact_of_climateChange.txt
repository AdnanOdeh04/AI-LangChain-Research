Climate Change and Its Global Impact

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The accumulation of greenhouse gases—like carbon dioxide and methane—in the atmosphere traps heat, leading to rising global temperatures. Consequences include more frequent and severe heatwaves, melting polar ice, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.

The global impact is profound: coastal communities face displacement due to flooding, agricultural productivity declines in regions prone to drought, and biodiversity loss threatens ecosystems. Mitigation strategies involve reducing emissions through renewable energy adoption, improving energy efficiency, and protecting forests. Adaptation measures, such as building resilient infrastructure and developing drought-resistant crops, are vital to cope with unavoidable changes. International cooperation under frameworks like the Paris Agreement seeks to limit warming and safeguard future generations.
